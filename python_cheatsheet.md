## Python Notes for future reference

#### Versions
Python 3.0 introduced many backwards-incompatible changes to the language, so code written for 2.7 may not work under 3.5 and vice versa.

#### Types
1. In python, you don't have x++, x-- operators.
2. Python also has built-in types for complex numbers.
3. and, or instead of "&&" and "||".
4. String objects have a bunch of useful methods.

#### Containers
Build-in container types: lists, dictionaries, sets and tuples
(Container type are all python objects that contain other object like list or dict).

##### Lists
A list is the Python equivalent of an array
